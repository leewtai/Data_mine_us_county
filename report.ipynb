        "The fake essay is trying to find the relationship between social vulnerability and changes in household composition (married vs. unmarried households) across U.S. counties using data from the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the American Community Survey. The student uses features like the slope an acceleration of household count trends and use k-means clustering to identify distinct household change patterns. After removing an outlier (LA), the student claims that four meaningful clusters were found. Attempts to predict cluster membership using random forest models and SVI features yield only modest accuracy, with age distribution, poverty, and housing cost emerging as the most informative variables.\n",

        "Non tech: In several of the graphs presented by the student, labels like ‘km_bag[,3]’ are used, which may confuse readers. Replacing these with more descriptive titles would make the data easier to interpret. Also, terminology such as 'curves that don't match' and '(see R/model.R for details)' should be explained more clearly so that the audience could have a quicker understanding of what is going on."
