    "Give a summary of what you think the following project is doing. Limit your answer to one paragraph.\n",
    "- It seems that the project is using Python to analyze and visualize data related to a US census. More specifically, it is utilizing regression to visualize and explain changes in households. It attempts to fit a curve to model the household data for each year for married and unmarried households, but has technical issues that limit its functionality. The project also includes code to generate features related to the time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please suggest at least one major non-technical improvement/correction they should do (e.g. writing, graphs, etc)\n",
    "- This is not completely related to code so I would consider it a non-technical improvement. They can improve the project by adding documentation to their methods. When I was going through the code, I found it difficult to understand what certain lines were meant to do or why they were even included. Something else they might consider is explaining why the year range of 2009 to 2023 was chosen. It isn't really explained so it isn't clear if this is arbitrary or if there's a specific reason for this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please suggest at least one major technical improvement/correction they should do.\n",
    "- The student should really check for exceptions that their code might throw and also find more *elegant* ways of writing their methods. For example, in the `fit_best_polynomial` method, it seems there are extra steps and weird conditions for the method to run that can be broken in a lot of cases. Like requiring X to be a a 2D array `(n, 1)` when it could be `(n,)`. Also, their slope calculation method was actually wrong since it was including a constant term that is not included in the derivative of the model. This resulted in null values. I also ran into a lot of exceptions when testing the code on sample data, which shows that the methods may not be generalized and might not work well with other datasets."
