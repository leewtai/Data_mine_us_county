## Summary

This project basically looks at how household structures (specifically counts of married and unmarried households) changed across U.S. counties from 2009-2022, and how these changes relate to broader socioeconomic vulnerabilities. They fitted polynomial curves to the household count data, extracted some features, clustered via k-means to look at some regional patterns, and then used a random forest model trained on SVI to predict clusters classes, which showed age distribution, poverty rates, and some other things were influential. The model achieved sort of moderate performance, though the insights about demographic vulnerability and household structures were not very consistent or straightforward.

## Non-technical improvement:

I would clarify/organize the “Features for both household counts” section. Many of the bullet points are vague such as “Actual the household count in 2022”. Besides using full sentences and consistent formatting, I would group the slope and acceleration under a subheader like *Derived Temporal Features*, each with a brief explanation and why the feature is important. It would also help to explicitly list all ten final features and why we normalized all of them as a separate 5 features for clustering. This restructuring would make it easier for readers to follow the logic and in general sort of just understand how household count data is being transformed into usable model inputs.

## Technical improvement: 

I looked at how the features were scaled prior to clustering. The original code applies standard z-score normalization across all columns, but it treats binary indicators the same as continuous features, and it assumes the distributions are probably symmetric, which may not be true for stuff like slope/count-based variables. Instead of replacing it with a different formula, I made it so the binary indicators are left without scaling and applied log to skewed features like household counts. For the remaining continuous variables, I centered by median and scaled by 25-75% range to reduce the impact of extreme values. These would hopefully reduce the outlier influence on clustering and make better groups. The updated clusters would then have clearer separation and fewer singleton cases.
