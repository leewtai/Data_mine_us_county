## 1. Summary

This project report analyzes how the Social Vulnerability Index relates to 
changes in household composition, but in specific the 
married-vs-unmarried-led households across all U.S. counties. In the 
project, the report extracts five features per household type (slope, 
acceleration, curve-fit status, 2022 count, and curve-fit failure flag). 
After normalizing (and removing an outlier county (LA) which may not be 
the best way to deal with this), k-means clustering is applied to identify 
four distinct county groups. After that, a random forest was trained on 
2020 SVI metrics to predict cluster membership, finding a barely better 
than random predictive power (~52â€“54% accuracy).

## 2. Major Non-Technical Improvement

Enhance figure caption:
- There are many plots which are well lead into but there is not enough 
caption or explanation of the graphs after the introduction and there are 
important insights and contextual insights from the graphs that could be 
important
Enhance cluster explanation:
- There is also not enough explanation contextually or in general on the 
clusters and what there groupings mean in context
- what areas are in the clusters beyond just the one example graphically?

## 3. Major Technical Improvement

Implemented technical correction was improving the read_csv code and 
adding set.seed because I could not find curve_feats_counties.csv which I 
needed to implement to be able to run either of the R files locally. 

If I could have tested it with all of the data, I would have considered 
fixing the binary no-curve flags as categorical rather than scaling them 
with continuous features:. This is because it does not make sense for them 
to be numeric for the k means calculations. Also the binary operators are 
included in the scale() which means they are distorting Euclidean 
distances in the k-means. These indicators should be excluded from the 
numeric standardization step and append them afterward, making sure they 
are categorical instead of numeric.
